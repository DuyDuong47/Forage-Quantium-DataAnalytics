# What is Forage?
Forage offers free, very short virtual work experiences, which are online programs designed and delivered by leading companies. Each virtual work experience contains a series of resources and tasks designed to simulate the real-world experience of starting a career.

To get started with the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Internship, Sign up for the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Internship on the [Forage website](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/quantium/data-analytics-rqkb)

# Quantium-DataAnalytics
These tasks work through a common narrative, designed to replicate life in the Retail Analytics and Strategy team at Quantium.  

# Task 1: Data preparation and customer analytics
Analyze your client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviors to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.
## Background information
You are part of Quantium’s retail analytics team and have been approached by your client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behavior within the region.

The insights from your analysis will feed into the supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

## Task
We need to present a strategic recommendation to Julia supported by data that she can then use for the upcoming category review. However, to do so, we need to analyze the data to understand the current purchasing trends and behaviors. The client is particularly interested in customer segments and their chip purchasing behavior. Consider what metrics would help describe the customers’ purchasing behavior.

## Folder Task 1
This [folder](https://github.com/DuyDuong47/Forage-Quantium-DataAnalytics/tree/a2182e8804e04e72207f49e78d47fa99e1ac0b80/Task%201%20-%20Data%20preparation%20and%20customer%20analytics) contains all the project files and resources for the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Internship Task 1.

# Task 2: Experimentation and uplift testing
Extend your analysis from Task 1 to help you identify benchmark stores that allow you to test the impact of the trial store layouts on customer sales.
## Background information
You are part of Quantium’s retail analytics team and have been approached by your client. The Category Manager for Chips has asked us to test the impact of the new trial layouts with a data-driven recommendation as to whether or not the trial layout should be rolled out to all their stores.

## Task
Julia has asked us to evaluate the performance of a store trial performed in stores 77, 86, and 88.

To get started, use the QVI_data dataset below or your output from task 1 and consider the monthly sales experience of each store:
- total sales revenue
- total number of customers
- average number of transactions per customer

Create a measure to compare different control stores to each of the trial stores to do this write a function to reduce having to re-do the analysis for each trial store. Consider using Pearson correlations or a metric such as a magnitude distance e.g. 1- (Observed distance – minimum distance)/(Maximum distance – minimum distance) as a measure.

Once you have selected your control stores, compare each trial and control pair during the trial period. You want to test if total sales are significantly different in the trial period and if so, check if the driver of change is more purchasing customers or more purchases per customer, etc.

## Folder Task 2
This [folder](https://github.com/DuyDuong47/Forage-Quantium-DataAnalytics/tree/a2182e8804e04e72207f49e78d47fa99e1ac0b80/Task%202%20-%20Experimentation%20and%20uplift%20testing) contains all the project files and resources for the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Internship Task 2.

# Task 3: Analytics and commercial application
You can use your analytics and insights from Tasks 1 and 2 to prepare a report for your client, the Category Manager.
## Background information
As both technical tasks 1 and 2 were open-ended in terms of insights, this model answer will focus on the layout and the order of your inclusions, including where to include graphs, taglines, written insights, and recommendations.

As part of Quantium’s retail analytics team, you have been conducting a range of analyses on transaction and purchase behavior data to provide key recommendations to your client, the Category Manager of chips, who is putting together their strategic plan.

## Task
With our project coming to an end it's time for us to send a report to Julia, based on our analytics from the previous tasks. We want to provide her with insights and recommendations that she can use when developing the strategic plan for the next half year.

For this report, we need to include data visualizations, key callouts, insights as well as recommendations and/or next steps.

## Folder Task 3
This [folder](https://github.com/DuyDuong47/Forage-Quantium-DataAnalytics/tree/a2182e8804e04e72207f49e78d47fa99e1ac0b80/Task%203%20-%20Analytics%20and%20commercial%20application) contains all the project files and resources for the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Internship Task 3.
