# Quantium-DataAnalytics
These tasks work through a common narrative, designed to replicate life in the Retail Analytics and Strategy team at Quantium. We therefore recommend completing each task in order from 1 to 3! 

# Task 1: Data preparation and customer analytics
Conduct analysis on your client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.

# Task 2: Experimentation and uplift testing
Extend your analysis from Task 1 to help you identify benchmark stores that allow you to test the impact of the trial store layouts on customer sales.

# Task 3: Analytics and commercial application
Use your analytics and insights from Task 1 and 2 to prepare a report for your client, the Category Manager.
